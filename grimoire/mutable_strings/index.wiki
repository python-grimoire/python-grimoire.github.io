! Problem:
 
Python's strings are immutable, so you can't change a single character of the string without constructing a new string. Sometimes this is a problem, particularly when dealing with very large strings; constructing a new string will require copying most of the original string, and can be slow. 
 
! Solution:
 
Use the <<PythonModule array>> module, which provides a mutable array data type that can only hold values of a single type. If used to hold only characters, an array behaves similarly to a mutable string. 
 
{{{
import array

A = array.array('c')
A.fromstring('hello there!')
print A
}}}
 
This prints: 
 
{{{
array('c', 'hello there!')
}}}
 
The array object {{{A}}} is mutable, so you can modify an element in place: 
 
{{{
A[0] = 'j'
print A
}}}
 
This will print: 
 
{{{
array('c', 'jello there!')
}}}
 
Most functions that require strings, such as {{{string.split()}}}, won't accept array objects, so you'll have to convert the array to a string in order to pass the data to certain functions: 
 
{{{
print string.split( A.tostring() )
}}}

But since both strings and arrays are [[sequence types|http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.1/lib/typesseq.html]], several forms of indexing and slicing can be performed on either.
